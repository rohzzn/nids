# Anomaly Detection in Wireless Networks 

AS-CNN is an approach proposed for enhancing anomaly detection in wireless networks, particularly focusing on addressing the vulnerabilities present in traditional methods. This project integrates Adaptive Synthetic Sampling (ADASYN) and a novel Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture, termed Split-Convolution CNN (SPC-CNN), to achieve improved accuracy, detection rates, and reduced false alarm rates compared to conventional IDS models.

## Key Features

- **ADASYN Integration:** Balances the sample distribution by generating synthetic samples for minority classes, thus mitigating the bias towards frequent classes commonly observed in imbalanced datasets.

- **SPC-CNN Architecture:** Utilizes Split-Convolution Modules to enhance feature diversity and eliminate interchannel redundancy during model training. This architecture enables the extraction of multi-scale features from oversampled data, improving the model's representation capability.

- **Performance Evaluation:** The AS-CNN model is evaluated using the widely-used NSL-KDD dataset, encompassing various attack types. Evaluation metrics include Accuracy (ACC), Detection Rate (DR), and False Alarm Rate (FAR), providing insights into the model's effectiveness in detecting anomalies.

## Datasets

 - KDDTrain
 - KDDTest+
 - KDDTest-21

## Results

- AS-CNN demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional CNN models, exhibiting higher accuracy, increased detection rates, and significantly reduced false alarm rates across different subsets of the NSL-KDD dataset.

- The model's robustness is particularly highlighted in its ability to detect minority attack classes such as Remote-to-Local (R2L) and User-to-Root (U2R) attacks, thereby enhancing cyber threat detection capabilities in wireless networks.
